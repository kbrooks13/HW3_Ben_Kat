```

## Average weight compared to sex for Rodents
```{r, echo=FALSE}
ggplot(rodent_sex_weight, aes(x=sex, y=mean_weight)) +
  geom_col()+xlab("SEX") + ylab("AVERAGE WEIGHT")


```

This graph shows the average weights for all rodents in the data set.  We found that for all rodents the average weight was not dependant on sex.
